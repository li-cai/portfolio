                 I'm Cailin, a third year student at Rochester Institute of Technology studying Software Engineering and New Media Interactive Development. I enjoy designing and developing interactive applications. Specifically my interests include mobile development, web development, and human computer interaction. My goal as a software engineer is to build maintainable systems and bring them to life with intuitive interfaces.Currently, I am looking for a Software Engineering Co-op or Internship through which I can challenge myself, gain new skills, and learn more about the software engineering process.
