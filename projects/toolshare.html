                <p>ToolShare is a web-based system for facilitating the sharing of tools within communities. I worked on this project as a part of a team of five Software Engineering students. Our ToolShare system supports many features such as user registration, tool registration, tool reservation, messaging, and communities for sharing called ShareZones.</p>
                <p>ToolShare was developed with <strong>Django</strong> using <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>SQLite</strong> and <strong>SVN</strong> for version control. In addition, we used <strong>BootStrap</strong> to assist with responsive design. The system was built after going through a software development cycle of requirements analysis, modeling, construction, testing, and deployment for two releases in four months. We also wrote comprehensive documentation for our system including the initial plan with a milestone schedule, the requirements spreadsheet with user stories and priority assessments, the design document with <strong>UML</strong> diagrams, and the test plan tracker. My team had weekly meetings and managed our sprints with <strong>Trello</strong>.</p>
                <p>Through working on this project, I gained experience working with a <strong>MVC</strong> framework. In addition, I wrote numerous unit tests, participated in code reviews, went through cross-team beta testing, and conducted acceptance tests.</p>
